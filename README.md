# ChowMates üçúü§ùüèΩ - Find Food Lovers Who Match Your Taste !

**ChowMates** is a powerful image-based search platform designed to connect food lovers with similar tastes. By leveraging advanced embeddings stored in PostgreSQL, our app enables users to find and discover like-minded individuals based on their food preferences.

## Key Features

- üçΩÔ∏è **Image-Based Search** ‚Äì Upload a picture of your favorite dish and find others who love it too.  
- üß† **AI-Powered Recommendations** ‚Äì Uses vector embeddings to deliver near-instant, highly relevant matches.
- üöÄ **Fast & Scalable** ‚Äì Optimized with PostgreSQL for efficient, real-time search performance.  

ChowMates isn't just about food‚Äîit's about building connections through shared tastes and culinary experiences! üçú‚ú®

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables `(.env.local)`

Before running the project, create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```

```

## Search Component Documentation

### Search Execution Flow
#### User Input & Processing
1. **User enters input** ‚Üí `query` state is updated.
2. **Press Enter or upload an image** ‚Üí `handleSearch()` function executes.
3. **Validation & Processing:**
   - If the query is a **valid image URL**, `fetchSimilarImagesByImageUrl()` is called.
   - If the query is a **website URL**, `fetchSimilarImagesByWebsite()` scrapes an image.
   - If the query is an **uploaded image**, `fetchSimilarImagesByImage()` is executed.
   - Otherwise, it assumes a **text-based search** and calls `fetchSimilarImagesByText()`.
4. **Results Display:**
   - Embeddings are displayed if available.
   - Scraped main image (if applicable) is shown.
   - Similar images are rendered in a grid layout.

### Conditional UI Behavior
- **If an embedding is generated**, it is displayed in a scrollable text box.
- **If a scraped image is found**, it is displayed alongside embeddings.
- **If similar images are retrieved**, they are displayed in a responsive grid.
- **If loading**, a spinner is displayed while fetching results.
- **If an error occurs**, an error message is shown to the user.

## Image Similarity Search - Database Schema & Workflow

This project implements an image similarity search system using vector embeddings. Below is the database schema and workflow.

---

### **Database Schema**
We use **two tables** to efficiently manage images.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ `images` Table (Updated Image Database)**
Stores preprocessed images with their embeddings and additional metadata.

| Column        | Type        | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| `ID`         | `INTEGER`   | Primary key |
| `CAFE`       | `JSONB`     | Cafe details in JSON format |
| `DESCRIPTION` | `VARCHAR`  | Description of the image |
| `IMAGE`      | `VARCHAR`   | URL of the stored image |
| `IMAGE_FILE` | `VARCHAR`   | Path or filename of the image |
| `NAME`       | `VARCHAR`   | Name of the item |
| `VECTOR`     | `VECTOR`    | Embedding vector of the image |
| `ADDRESS`    | `VARCHAR`   | Physical address |
| `CATEGORIES` | `TEXT[]`    | Array of category labels |
| `MENU_ID`    | `VARCHAR`   | ID of the menu to which the item belongs |
| `NAME_CAFE`  | `VARCHAR`   | Name of the cafe |
| `RATING`     | `NUMERIC`   | Rating of the item or cafe |
| `SLUG`       | `VARCHAR`   | SEO-friendly identifier |
| `LOCATION_LAT` | `NUMERIC` | Latitude coordinate |
| `LOCATION_LON` | `NUMERIC` | Longitude coordinate |

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ `uploads` Table (User-Uploaded Images)**
Stores images uploaded by users before performing similarity searches.

| Column      | Type            | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| `id`       | `SERIAL`        | Primary key |
| `image_url` | `TEXT`          | URL of the uploaded image |
| `embedding` | `VECTOR(512)`   | Generated embedding for the uploaded image |
| `uploaded_at` | `TIMESTAMP`   | Upload timestamp |

---

### **Workflow: How It Works**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **A user uploads an image** ‚Üí An embedding is generated and stored in the `uploads` table.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Find the most similar image in the database** ‚Üí Compare embeddings in the `images` table using vector distance:  

```sql
SELECT id, image_url
FROM images
ORDER BY embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM uploads WHERE id = ?)
LIMIT 10;
```
